## 🎯 How It Works

### The Two-Folder System

**1. 📁 SaveMods Folder (Your Library)**
- Store ALL your downloaded mods here permanently
- Can be anywhere on your system
- Original files stay safe and untouched

**2. 🔗 Mods Folder (Active Mods)**
- Where 3DMigoto/XXMI loads mods from during gameplay
- Contains symbolic links to active mods only
- Managed automatically by the app

**Example:**
```
SaveMods (Library)              →     Mods (Active)
├── Ellen_BeachOutfit/          →     [link] → Ellen_BeachOutfit/
├── Miyabi_Kimono/                    (inactive, no link)
├── Burnice_Casual/             →     [link] → Burnice_Casual/
└── Jane_SchoolGirl/                  (inactive, no link)
```

**Benefits:**
- 💾 No duplicate files = Save disk space
- ⚡ Instant enable/disable = Just create/remove links  
- 🛡️ Safe = Original files never modified
- 📦 Organized = Library separate from active mods
